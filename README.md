# capstone-project "Toffee Time"



The idea for my cupstone project is to help with productivity while studying or working from home.

The end-users: students/freelancers.
The problem:to be productive while working from home. 
Why: lack of time management may results in stress, anxiety, missed deadlines.

Technologies used
for the project for each 
step of the way:
HTML, SASS, ReactJs, NODE, Express;

TIMERS AND QUOTES STORED IN MY EXPRESS SERVER.
SINCE TIMERS ARE VERY SIMULAR TO ONE ANOTHER, I AM SHARING A STATE IN ONE PARENT COMPONENT.
ENTERED TASKS STORED IN THE SESSION STORAGE

There is a checkbox added together with the text when entereing info in the task list (inside the timers)
I could not figure out how to pass it to, so it is displayed on the end record page.

I ran into infinite loops while working with timers, writing more precise if statement and storing data in the back server helped.

For the future project development I am planning to implement databases, user accounts, perhaps make an option to save custom timers, make weekly/monthly productivity reports that will use information such as how many hours user usually works, how many work sessions, how long work sessions and break sessions and etc.

Thank you for your time.
